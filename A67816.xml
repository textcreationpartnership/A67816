            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Copy of a PAPER Written by the Late Dutcheſs of York, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is ſo reaſonable to expect, that a Perſon always bred up in the <hi>Ch</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and as well inſtructed in the Doctrine of it, (as the beſt Divines, and her Capacity could make her) ſhould be lyable to many cenſures, for leaving That, and making her ſelf a Member of the <hi>Rom. Cath. Ch.</hi> to which, I confeſs, I was one of the greateſt Enemies it ever had; That I rather chooſe to ſatisfy my Friends by reading this Paper, than to have the trouble to anſwer all the Queſtions that may daily be ask'd me: And firſt, I do proteſt in the preſence of Almighty God, that no Perſon, Man, or Woman, directly, nor indirectly, ever ſaid any thing to me ſince I came into <hi>England,</hi> or us'd the leaſt endeavour to make me change my Religion; <hi>It</hi> is a Bleſſing <hi>I</hi> wholly owe to Almighty God, and <hi>I</hi> hope the hearing of a Prayer <hi>I</hi> daily made him, ever ſince <hi>I</hi> was in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> Where ſeeing much of the Devotion of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> (tho' <hi>I</hi> had very little my ſelf.) <hi>I</hi> made it my continual Requeſt to Almighty God, That if <hi>I</hi> were not, <hi>I</hi> might before <hi>I</hi> dy'd, be in the true Religion: <hi>I</hi> did not in the leaſt doubt, but that <hi>I</hi> was ſo, and never had any Scruple till <hi>Nov.</hi> laſt, when reading a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> had heard very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and have been told, if ever <hi>I</hi> had any doubt of my Religion, that would ſettle me: Inſtead of which, I found it the deſcription of the horrideſt Sacriledges in the World; and could find no reaſon why we left the Church, but for three the moſt abominable ones, that were ever heard of among Chriſtians. Firſt, <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> renounces the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, becauſe he would not give him leave to part with his Wife, and marry another in her life-time. Secondly, <hi>Edward VI.</hi> was a Child, and govern'd by his Uncle, who made his Eſtate out of <hi>Church-Lands.</hi> And then Queen <hi>E.</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Lawful Heireſs to the Crown, could have no way to keep it, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a Church that could never ſuffer ſo unlawful a thing to be done by one of her Children. <hi>I</hi> confeſs, <hi>I</hi> cannot think the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> could ever be in ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; And it is very ſtrange, that, if the Biſhops had no Deſign, but (as they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay) the reſtoring us to the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, they could never think upon't, till <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> made the breach upon ſo unlawful a Pretence. Theſe Scruples being rais'd, I began to conſider of the difference between the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> and examin'd them as well as I could by Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> which, tho' <hi>I</hi> do not pretend to be able to underſtand, yet there are ſome things <hi>I</hi> found ſo eaſy, that <hi>I</hi> cannot but wonder, <hi>I</hi> had been ſo long without finding them out: <hi>As the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Infallibility of the Church, Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Praying

                  <hi>Sheldon</hi> A. B. of <hi>Cant.</hi>
               </note> After this, I ſpoke ſeverally to two of the beſt Biſhops we have in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who both told me there were many things in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church which (it were very much to be wiſh'd) we had kept; As <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which was, no doubt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Blanford,</hi> B. of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> B. of <hi>W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> That Praying for the Dead, was one of the Antient things in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: That for their parts, They did it daily, tho they would not own it: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, preſſing one of them very much upon the other points, he told me, <hi>That if he had been bred a</hi> Catholick, <hi>he would not change his Religion; But that being of another Church, (wherein, he was ſure, were all things neceſſary to Salvation,) he thohght it very ill, to give that ſcandal, as to leave that Church wherein he receiv'd his Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe diſcourſes did but add more to the deſire I had to be a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and gave me the moſt terrible Agonies in the World within my ſelf; for all this, fearing to be raſh in a matter of that weight, I did all I could to ſatisfy my ſelf, made it my daily Prayer to God, to ſettle me in the Right; and ſo went on <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> to Receive in the <hi>Kings-Chappel:</hi> After which, I was more troubled than ever, and could never be at quiet, till I had told my deſign to a <hi>Catholick,</hi> who brought a Prieſt to me, and that was the firſt I ever did converſe with, upon my word. The more I ſpoke to him, the more I was confirm'd in my deſign; And, as it is impoſſible for me to doubt the words of our Bleſſed Saviour, who ſays, the <hi>Holy Sacrament is his Body and Blood;</hi> ſo cannot believe, that He, who is the Author of all Truth, and has promis'd to be <hi>with his Church to the end of the World,</hi> would permit them to give that Holy Myſtery to the Laity but in one kind, if it were not lawful ſo to do.</p>
            <p>I am not able, or, if I were, would enter into Diſputes with any Body; I only in ſhort, ſay this for the changing of my Religion, which I take God to witneſs I would never have done, if I had thought it poſſible to ſave my Soul otherwiſe. I think I need not ſay, it is any Intereſt in this World leads me to it: It will be plain enough to every body, that I muſt loſe all the Friends and Credit I have here, by it; and have very well weighed, which I could beſt part with, my ſhare in this World, or the next: I thank God I found no difficulty in the choice.</p>
